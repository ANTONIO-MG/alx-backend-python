Asynchronous Python Tasks Directory
This directory contains several Python files demonstrating asynchronous programming with asyncio in Python.

Files:
0-basic_async_syntax.py

This file contains a coroutine wait_random that simulates a random delay using asyncio's asyncio.sleep.
It provides foundational async syntax examples.
1-concurrent_coroutines.py

This file includes a function wait_n that demonstrates concurrent execution of coroutines using asyncio.
It showcases running multiple tasks concurrently.
2-measure_runtime.py

This script defines a function measure_time to measure the average execution time of concurrent tasks using asyncio.
It illustrates how to benchmark asynchronous tasks.
3-tasks.py

This module offers utility functions like task_wait_random and task_wait_n to manage asyncio tasks.
4-tasks.py

This script builds upon 3-tasks.py, enhancing concurrent task execution management.
